Description
-----------
This module dispatches events for several drupal core hooks. This allows you to use the D8 Event Subscriber system
instead of the outdated hook system to react on certain events. The module includes events for the most common hooks.

If you want to see new events registered, open an issue in the issue queue and I will try to add it.
Hopefully, in the near future, D8 core will put this into core.

Installation
------------
To install this module, do the following:

1. Extract the tar ball that you downloaded from Drupal.org.

2. Upload the entire directory and all its contents to your modules directory.

Examples
---------
You can find an example on how to use each dispatcher in src/Example
